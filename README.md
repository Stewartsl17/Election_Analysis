# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview 
Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, has tasked us with completing the election audit of a recent local congressional election. In order to replicate this process for future elections, our client wanted us to write script in Python. The steps of the script are as follows: 

1. Open the data file.
2. Write down the names of all the candidates.
3. Add a vote count for each candidate.
3. Get the total votes for each candidate.
4. Get the total votes cast for the election.
